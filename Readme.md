# About

___

 Airhug is an Open source project, that aims to exercise a new culture of internet consumption. Airhug extension allows to send "hug", which is a new generation "like", backed up by a customizable sum of money ( from $0.1 up to $100). The "hug" icon is integrated into all supported social networks near by the "like" icon. Hug allows you to send donations for digital content in one click.


In addition to social networks, a button can be set by any sites, blogs, and so on. Just insert a piece of code into your web page and start getting "hugs".

ðŸŒ€ Currently in development, functionality is partly unavailable.
Backend: [Airhug server part](https://github.com/WcAmbros/airhug_server)

# For whom

## Bloggers
"Hug" allows narrow-minded and growing bloggers to start earning money without advertising integrations.

For professional bloggers "hug" is an opportunity to get real money feedback from audience and become more independent.

Bloggers can also customize their profile so that all of their "hugs" are immediately redirected to a charity fund. This can be done anonymously.

A small part of the commission from all bloggers transactions is credited to the accounts of charity organizations.


## Crowdfunders & Charity
It has become easier now to collect a large amount of money for treating a dog or starting a business: the philanthropist does not need to spend time entering his details into a special form.

Charity transfers are free of charge.
